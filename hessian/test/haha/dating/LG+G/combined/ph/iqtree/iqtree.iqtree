SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT
------------------

Input data: 5 sequences with 100 amino-acid sites
Number of constant sites: 71 (= 71% of all sites)
Number of invariant (constant or ambiguous constant) sites: 71 (= 71% of all sites)
Number of parsimony informative sites: 14
Number of distinct site patterns: 49

SUBSTITUTION PROCESS
--------------------

Model of substitution: LG+G4

State frequencies: (model)

Model of rate heterogeneity: Gamma with 4 categories
Gamma shape alpha: 0.5324

 Category  Relative_rate  Proportion
  1         0.0395         0.2500
  2         0.2725         0.2500
  3         0.8425         0.2500
  4         2.8455         0.2500
Relative rates are computed as MEAN of the portion of the Gamma distribution falling in the category.

USER TREE
---------

Unconstrained log-likelihood (without tree): -351.4737
Number of free parameters (#branches + #model parameters): 8
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score: 1027.2192
Corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) score: 1028.8016
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score: 1048.0605

Total tree length (sum of branch lengths): 0.5083
Sum of internal branch lengths: 0.2526 (49.6965% of tree length)

NOTE: Tree is UNROOTED although outgroup taxon 't1' is drawn at root

ALISIM COMMAND
--------------
To simulate an alignment of the same length as the original alignment, using the tree and model parameters estimated from this analysis, you can use the following command:

--alisim simulated_MSA -t haha/dating/LG+G/ph/iqtree/iqtree.treefile -m "LG+G4{0.532368}" --length 100

To mimic the alignment used to produce this analysis, i.e. simulate an alignment of the same length as the original alignment, using the tree and model parameters estimated from this analysis *and* copying the same gap positions as the original alignment, you can use the following command:

iqtree -s haha/sim/alignment/combined.fas --alisim mimicked_MSA

To simulate any number of alignments in either of the two commandlines above, use the --num-alignments options, for example mimic 100 alignments you would use the command line:

iqtree -s haha/sim/alignment/combined.fas --alisim mimicked_MSA --num-alignments 100
